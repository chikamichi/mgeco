mg-ecoconstruction.com â€” Gallery generator
==========================

mg-ecoconstruction.com's gallery is built on top of Photoswipe. This project automates the creation of the required markup, dynamically parsing the gallery's images to expose their dimensions, for instance. Output is then automatically moved at the appropriate location in the website/ project.

## Usage

This project provides **two main commands**:

``` sh
./bin/generate-thumbnails
```

generates thumbnails from larger size, original pictures stored in ../website/static/images/gallery/.

```
./bin/generate-gallery
```

generates a full-flegded, Hugo-compliant, production-ready gallery layout that is automatically transfered at ../website/themes/mgeco/layouts/galerie/single.html.

It's also through this project that one controls the gallery's content: images orders & captions (see src/html/gallery/images_list.yml).

## Development

Install project's dependencies first: `npm install`.

### Compiling

* Compile vendors' JS bundle (Webpack DLL): `npm run build:vendor`
* Compile project's bundle: `npm run build [-- --watch]`
* Compile project's bundle minified/compressed: `NODE_ENV=production npm run build[:vendor]`

### Adding a third-party library

1. Add the library to package.json (or `npm i -[S|D] library_name`)
2. Require the library from src/js/vendors.js
3. Rebuild the vendors DLL with `npm run build:vendor`
